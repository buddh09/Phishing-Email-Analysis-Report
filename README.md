## ⚠️ Indicators of Phishing

| Indicator              | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fake Sender Domain** | Uses `@bigdogdomains.co`, not associated with official GitHub domain.       |
| **Spoofed Branding**   | GitHub logo and design elements used to appear legitimate.                  |
| **Urgent CTA**         | Urges user to verify email quickly, a common phishing tactic.               |
| **Generic Greeting**   | Uses "Demo" instead of the actual name, indicating mass phishing attempt.   |
| **Suspicious URL**     | Button may lead to a phishing or malicious site (not visible in screenshot).|

## 📬 Email Authentication: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC

To verify if an email is truly sent by a domain, authentication protocols are checked:

### 🔎 How to View Results (Gmail Example)

1. Open the email.
2. Click the three vertical dots (⋮) in the top-right corner.
3. Select **"Show original"**.
4. Look for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results.

### 🧪 Sample Results:

- **SPF**: FAIL  
- **DKIM**: FAIL  
- **DMARC**: FAIL

### 🔍 Interpretation

| Protocol | Result | Meaning                                                         |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| SPF      | FAIL   | The sender’s IP is not authorized to send mail for that domain. |
| DKIM     | FAIL   | The message was not signed or signature didn’t match.           |
| DMARC    | FAIL   | The domain policy was not enforced or failed alignment checks.  |

---

##  Additional Recommendations

-  **Publish a valid SPF record** with all authorized sending IPs.
-  **Sign emails using DKIM** to verify message integrity.
-  **Implement a DMARC policy** (e.g., `p=reject`) to block spoofed emails.
-  **Monitor SPF/DKIM/DMARC reports** regularly for unauthorized activity.
